# Latin Vocabulary Tester

Provides a way to test your knowledge of the GCSE and A-Level Latin vocabulary list, while also containing a Latin Noun Declension Tester. This was primarily created for fun and started during the coronavirus lockdown, but I'm hoping that it can offer some help. Here's some of what it provides:

- Practise your vocabulary
- If you've enabled answering in Latin, verify that you know each principle part or form
- Focus on exclusively the vocabulary that you've answered incorrectly once the test includes
- CSV exports (can be used with Google Sheets) of words answered incorrectly
- Competitive mode with a functioning leaderboard

If there is any desire to use it, I'm happy to ensure it functions better with additional features. Feel free to let me know if there are any issues or requests, including if it involves adding new vocabulary!
